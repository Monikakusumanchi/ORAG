We prohibit discrimination and harassment in all forms and provide equal access to employment opportunities, promotions, training, and benefits. Any employee who believes they have experienced discrimination should report it immediately to Human Resources or use our anonymous reporting system.

### At-Will Employment

Employment with TechCorp Solutions is at-will, meaning either the employee or the company may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, subject to applicable law.

This handbook does not create a contract of employment, and company policies may be modified at management's discretion. Employees will be notified of significant policy changes through official company communications.
